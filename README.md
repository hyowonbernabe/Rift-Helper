# Rift Helper

Rift Helper is a Java-based automation tool designed to streamline the queuing process in *League of Legends*, enhancing efficiency and user experience.

## How It Works

Rift Helper leverages the *League Client Update (LCU) API* to communicate directly with the League of Legends client. This ensures seamless automation **without** the use of injection, hooking, or pixel searching, maintaining compliance with standard client interactions.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the **Releases** tab.  
2. Install the application using the provided MSI installer.  
3. Launch the *League of Legends* client **before** running Rift Helper.  

## Disclaimer

- The *LCU API* is **not officially supported** by Riot Games, and its usage may carry risks, including potential account penalties.  
- By using this software, you acknowledge and accept any risks involved.  
- I am **not responsible** for any consequences, including but not limited to, account restrictions, bans, or other issues that may arise from using Rift Helper.
